JFFNBPT - Java Free-Form NetBeans Project Template

One day I realized that would like to be able to edit Ant build scripts manually,
and use IDE only for refactoring. NB is my favorite IDE so, that's why I decided
to make a unzip-rename-start_working template for it.

Basically, that is why You're reading this text ;).

Created in environment:

    Product Version: NetBeans IDE 7.0 (Build 201104080000)
    Java: 1.6.0_24; Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 19.1-b02
    System: Linux version 2.6.32-28-generic running on amd64; UTF-8; en_US (nb)
    Userdir: /home/alexander/.netbeans/7.0

Please consider changing following in order to make it work if it doesn't 'work from the box':

    1. Rename 'alexander.properties' file to 'your_system_username.properties'
    2. Adjust it's contents according to your needs. Remember it overrides 
       properties set in 'default.properties' file so use contents of the last
       as an example, but do not delete it.
    3. In case you will rename project folder manually (not using NetBeans),
       consider making appropriate changes to ./nbproject/project.xml file.

No warranties that this template will work from first run in your environment, or work at all. 

Feel free to contact me. 
At least I will try to help.
